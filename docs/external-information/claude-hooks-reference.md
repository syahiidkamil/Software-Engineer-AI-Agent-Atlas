Hooks are user-defined shell commands, HTTP endpoints, or LLM prompts that execute automatically at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. Use this reference to look up event schemas, configuration options, JSON input/output formats, and advanced features like async hooks, HTTP hooks, and MCP tool hooks. If you're setting up hooks for the first time, start with the [guide](/en/hooks-guide) instead.

## Hook lifecycle

Hooks fire at specific points during a Claude Code session. When an event fires and a matcher matches, Claude Code passes JSON context about the event to your hook handler. For command hooks, input arrives on stdin. For HTTP hooks, it arrives as the POST request body. Your handler can then inspect the input, take action, and optionally return a decision. Events fall into three cadences: once per session (`SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`), once per turn (`UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`), and on every tool call inside the agentic loop (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`):

### How a hook resolves

To see how these pieces fit together, consider this `PreToolUse` hook that blocks destructive shell commands. The `matcher` narrows to Bash tool calls and the `if` condition narrows further to Bash subcommands matching `rm *`, so `block-rm.sh` only spawns when both filters match:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "if": "Bash(rm *)",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/block-rm.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The script reads the JSON input from stdin, extracts the command, and returns a `permissionDecision` of `"deny"` if it contains `rm -rf`:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/block-rm.sh
COMMAND=$(jq -r '.tool_input.command')

if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -q 'rm -rf'; then
  jq -n '{
    hookSpecificOutput: {
      hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
      permissionDecision: "deny",
      permissionDecisionReason: "Destructive command blocked by hook"
    }
  }'
else
  exit 0  # allow the command
fi
```

Now suppose Claude Code decides to run `Bash "rm -rf /tmp/build"`. Here's what happens:

  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/-tYw1BD_DEqfyyOZ/images/hook-resolution.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=-tYw1BD_DEqfyyOZ&q=85&s=c73ebc1eeda2037570427d7af1e0a891" alt="Hook resolution flow: PreToolUse event fires, matcher checks for Bash match, if condition checks for Bash(rm *) match, hook handler runs, result returns to Claude Code" width="930" height="290" data-path="images/hook-resolution.svg" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event fires">
    The `PreToolUse` event fires. Claude Code sends the tool input as JSON on stdin to the hook:

    ```json theme={null}
    { "tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": { "command": "rm -rf /tmp/build" }, ... }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Matcher checks">
    The matcher `"Bash"` matches the tool name, so this hook group activates. If you omit the matcher or use `"*"`, the group activates on every occurrence of the event.
  </Step>

  <Step title="If condition checks">
    The `if` condition `"Bash(rm *)"` matches because `rm -rf /tmp/build` is a subcommand matching `rm *`, so this handler spawns. If the command had been `npm test`, the `if` check would fail and `block-rm.sh` would never run, avoiding the process spawn overhead. The `if` field is optional; without it, every handler in the matched group runs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hook handler runs">
    The script inspects the full command and finds `rm -rf`, so it prints a decision to stdout:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hookSpecificOutput": {
        "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
        "permissionDecision": "deny",
        "permissionDecisionReason": "Destructive command blocked by hook"
      }
    }
    ```

    If the command had been a safer `rm` variant like `rm file.txt`, the script would hit `exit 0` instead, which tells Claude Code to allow the tool call with no further action.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude Code acts on the result">
    Claude Code reads the JSON decision, blocks the tool call, and shows Claude the reason.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The [Configuration](#configuration) section below documents the full schema, and each [hook event](#hook-events) section documents what input your command receives and what output it can return.

## Configuration

Hooks are defined in JSON settings files. The configuration has three levels of nesting:

1. Choose a [hook event](#hook-events) to respond to, like `PreToolUse` or `Stop`
2. Add a [matcher group](#matcher-patterns) to filter when it fires, like "only for the Bash tool"
3. Define one or more [hook handlers](#hook-handler-fields) to run when matched

See [How a hook resolves](#how-a-hook-resolves) above for a complete walkthrough with an annotated example.

<Note>
  This page uses specific terms for each level: **hook event** for the lifecycle point, **matcher group** for the filter, and **hook handler** for the shell command, HTTP endpoint, MCP tool, prompt, or agent that runs. "Hook" on its own refers to the general feature.
</Note>

### Hook locations

Where you define a hook determines its scope:

| Location                                                   | Scope                         | Shareable                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json`                                  | All your projects             | No, local to your machine          |
| `.claude/settings.json`                                    | Single project                | Yes, can be committed to the repo  |
| `.claude/settings.local.json`                              | Single project                | No, gitignored                     |
| Managed policy settings                                    | Organization-wide             | Yes, admin-controlled              |
| [Plugin](/en/plugins) `hooks/hooks.json`                   | When plugin is enabled        | Yes, bundled with the plugin       |
| [Skill](/en/skills) or [agent](/en/sub-agents) frontmatter | While the component is active | Yes, defined in the component file |

For details on settings file resolution, see [settings](/en/settings). Enterprise administrators can use `allowManagedHooksOnly` to block user, project, and plugin hooks. Hooks from plugins force-enabled in managed settings `enabledPlugins` are exempt, so administrators can distribute vetted hooks through an organization marketplace. See [Hook configuration](/en/settings#hook-configuration).

### Matcher patterns

The `matcher` field filters when hooks fire. How a matcher is evaluated depends on the characters it contains:

| Matcher value                       | Evaluated as                                          | Example                                                                                                            |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"*"`, `""`, or omitted             | Match all                                             | fires on every occurrence of the event                                                                             |
| Only letters, digits, `_`, and `\|` | Exact string, or `\|`-separated list of exact strings | `Bash` matches only the Bash tool; `Edit\|Write` matches either tool exactly                                       |
| Contains any other character        | JavaScript regular expression                         | `^Notebook` matches any tool starting with Notebook; `mcp__memory__.*` matches every tool from the `memory` server |

The `FileChanged` event does not follow these rules when building its watch list. See [FileChanged](#filechanged).

Each event type matches on a different field:

| Event                                                                                                                           | What the matcher filters                                     | Example matcher values                                                                                                    |

| `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolBatch`, `Stop`, `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove` | no matcher support                                           | always fires on every occurrence                                                                                          |

The matcher runs against a field from the [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) that Claude Code sends to your hook on stdin. For tool events, that field is `tool_name`. Each [hook event](#hook-events) section lists the full set of matcher values and the input schema for that event.

This example runs a linting script only when Claude writes or edits a file:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/lint-check.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolBatch`, `Stop`, `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove`, and `CwdChanged` don't support matchers and always fire on every occurrence. If you add a `matcher` field to these events, it is silently ignored.

For tool events, you can filter more narrowly by setting the [`if` field](#common-fields) on individual hook handlers. `if` uses [permission rule syntax](/en/permissions) to match against the tool name and arguments together, so `"Bash(git *)"` runs when any subcommand of the Bash input matches `git *` and `"Edit(*.ts)"` runs only for TypeScript files.

#### Match MCP tools

[MCP](/en/mcp) server tools appear as regular tools in tool events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`, `PermissionDenied`), so you can match them the same way you match any other tool name.

MCP tools follow the naming pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

* `mcp__memory__create_entities`: Memory server's create entities tool
* `mcp__filesystem__read_file`: Filesystem server's read file tool
* `mcp__github__search_repositories`: GitHub server's search tool

To match every tool from a server, append `.*` to the server prefix. The `.*` is required: a matcher like `mcp__memory` contains only letters and underscores, so it is compared as an exact string and matches no tool.

* `mcp__memory__.*` matches all tools from the `memory` server
* `mcp__.*__write.*` matches any tool whose name starts with `write` from any server

This example logs all memory server operations and validates write operations from any MCP server:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hook handler fields

Each object in the inner `hooks` array is a hook handler: the shell command, HTTP endpoint, MCP tool, LLM prompt, or agent that runs when the matcher matches. There are five types:

* **[Command hooks](#command-hook-fields)** (`type: "command"`): run a shell command. Your script receives the event's [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) on stdin and communicates results back through exit codes and stdout.
* **[HTTP hooks](#http-hook-fields)** (`type: "http"`): send the event's JSON input as an HTTP POST request to a URL. The endpoint communicates results back through the response body using the same [JSON output format](#json-output) as command hooks.
* **[MCP tool hooks](#mcp-tool-hook-fields)** (`type: "mcp_tool"`): call a tool on an already-connected [MCP server](/en/mcp). The tool's text output is treated like command-hook stdout.
* **[Prompt hooks](#prompt-and-agent-hook-fields)** (`type: "prompt"`): send a prompt to a Claude model for single-turn evaluation. The model returns a yes/no decision as JSON. See [Prompt-based hooks](#prompt-based-hooks).
* **[Agent hooks](#prompt-and-agent-hook-fields)** (`type: "agent"`): spawn a subagent that can use tools like Read, Grep, and Glob to verify conditions before returning a decision. Agent hooks are experimental and may change. See [Agent-based hooks](#agent-based-hooks).

#### Common fields

These fields apply to all hook types:

| Field           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`          | yes      | `"command"`, `"http"`, `"mcp_tool"`, `"prompt"`, or `"agent"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `if`            | no       | Permission rule syntax to filter when this hook runs, such as `"Bash(git *)"` or `"Edit(*.ts)"`. The hook only spawns if the tool call matches the pattern, or if a Bash command is too complex to parse. Only evaluated on tool events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`, and `PermissionDenied`. On other events, a hook with `if` set never runs. Uses the same syntax as [permission rules](/en/permissions) |
| `timeout`       | no       | Seconds before canceling. Defaults: 600 for command, 30 for prompt, 60 for agent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `statusMessage` | no       | Custom spinner message displayed while the hook runs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `once`          | no       | If `true`, runs once per session then is removed. Only honored for hooks declared in [skill frontmatter](#hooks-in-skills-and-agents); ignored in settings files and agent frontmatter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The `if` field holds exactly one permission rule. There is no `&&`, `||`, or list syntax for combining rules; to apply multiple conditions, define a separate hook handler for each. For Bash, the rule is matched against each subcommand of the tool input after leading `VAR=value` assignments are stripped, so `if: "Bash(git push *)"` matches both `FOO=bar git push` and `npm test && git push`. The hook runs if any subcommand matches, and always runs when the command is too complex to parse.

#### Command hook fields

In addition to the [common fields](#common-fields), command hooks accept these fields:

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `command`     | yes      | Shell command to execute                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `async`       | no       | If `true`, runs in the background without blocking. See [Run hooks in the background](#run-hooks-in-the-background)                                                                                                                   |
| `asyncRewake` | no       | If `true`, runs in the background and wakes Claude on exit code 2. Implies `async`. The hook's stderr, or stdout if stderr is empty, is shown to Claude as a system reminder so it can react to a long-running background failure     |
| `shell`       | no       | Shell to use for this hook. Accepts `"bash"` (default) or `"powershell"`. Setting `"powershell"` runs the command via PowerShell on Windows. Does not require `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL` since hooks spawn PowerShell directly |

In addition to the [common fields](#common-fields), HTTP hooks accept these fields:

| Field            | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`            | yes      | URL to send the POST request to                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `headers`        | no       | Additional HTTP headers as key-value pairs. Values support environment variable interpolation using `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` syntax. Only variables listed in `allowedEnvVars` are resolved  |
| `allowedEnvVars` | no       | List of environment variable names that may be interpolated into header values. References to unlisted variables are replaced with empty strings. Required for any env var interpolation to work |

Claude Code sends the hook's [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) as the POST request body with `Content-Type: application/json`. The response body uses the same [JSON output format](#json-output) as command hooks.

Error handling differs from command hooks: non-2xx responses, connection failures, and timeouts all produce non-blocking errors that allow execution to continue. To block a tool call or deny a permission, return a 2xx response with a JSON body containing `decision: "block"` or a `hookSpecificOutput` with `permissionDecision: "deny"`.

This example sends `PreToolUse` events to a local validation service, authenticating with a token from the `MY_TOKEN` environment variable:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "http://localhost:8080/hooks/pre-tool-use",
            "timeout": 30,
            "headers": {
              "Authorization": "Bearer $MY_TOKEN"
            },
            "allowedEnvVars": ["MY_TOKEN"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### MCP tool hook fields

In addition to the [common fields](#common-fields), MCP tool hooks accept these fields:

| Field    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server` | yes      | Name of a configured MCP server. The server must already be connected; the hook never triggers an OAuth or connection flow                                           |
| `tool`   | yes      | Name of the tool to call on that server                                                                                                                              |
| `input`  | no       | Arguments passed to the tool. String values support `${path}` substitution from the hook's [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output), such as `"${tool_input.file_path}"` |

The tool's text content is treated like command-hook stdout: if it parses as valid [JSON output](#json-output) it is processed as a decision, otherwise it is shown as plain text. If the named server is not connected, or the tool returns `isError: true`, the hook produces a non-blocking error and execution continues.

MCP tool hooks are available on every hook event once Claude Code has connected to your MCP servers. `SessionStart` and `Setup` typically fire before servers finish connecting, so hooks on those events should expect the "not connected" error on first run.

This example calls the `security_scan` tool on the `my_server` MCP server after each `Write` or `Edit`, passing the edited file's path:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "mcp_tool",
            "server": "my_server",
            "tool": "security_scan",
            "input": { "file_path": "${tool_input.file_path}" }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Prompt and agent hook fields

In addition to the [common fields](#common-fields), prompt and agent hooks accept these fields:

| Field    | Required | Description                                                                                 |
| :------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `prompt` | yes      | Prompt text to send to the model. Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a placeholder for the hook input JSON |
| `model`  | no       | Model to use for evaluation. Defaults to a fast model                                       |

All matching hooks run in parallel, and identical handlers are deduplicated automatically. Command hooks are deduplicated by command string, and HTTP hooks are deduplicated by URL. Handlers run in the current directory with Claude Code's environment. The `$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable is set to `"true"` in remote web environments and not set in the local CLI.

### Reference scripts by path

Use environment variables to reference hook scripts relative to the project or plugin root, regardless of the working directory when the hook runs:

* `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`: the project root. Wrap in quotes to handle paths with spaces.
* `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: the plugin's installation directory, for scripts bundled with a [plugin](/en/plugins). Changes on each plugin update.
* `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`: the plugin's [persistent data directory](/en/plugins-reference#persistent-data-directory), for dependencies and state that should survive plugin updates.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project scripts">
    This example uses `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` to run a style checker from the project's `.claude/hooks/` directory after any `Write` or `Edit` tool call:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hooks": {
        "PostToolUse": [
          {
            "matcher": "Write|Edit",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "type": "command",
                "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Plugin scripts">
    Define plugin hooks in `hooks/hooks.json` with an optional top-level `description` field. When a plugin is enabled, its hooks merge with your user and project hooks.

    This example runs a formatting script bundled with the plugin:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "description": "Automatic code formatting",
      "hooks": {
        "PostToolUse": [
          {
            "matcher": "Write|Edit",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "type": "command",
                "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format.sh",
                "timeout": 30
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

### Hooks in skills and agents

In addition to settings files and plugins, hooks can be defined directly in [skills](/en/skills) and [subagents](/en/sub-agents) using frontmatter. These hooks are scoped to the component's lifecycle and only run when that component is active.

All hook events are supported. For subagents, `Stop` hooks are automatically converted to `SubagentStop` since that is the event that fires when a subagent completes.

Hooks use the same configuration format as settings-based hooks but are scoped to the component's lifetime and cleaned up when it finishes.

This skill defines a `PreToolUse` hook that runs a security validation script before each `Bash` command:

```yaml theme={null}
---
name: secure-operations
description: Perform operations with security checks
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/security-check.sh"
---
```

Agents use the same format in their YAML frontmatter.

### The `/hooks` menu

Type `/hooks` in Claude Code to open a read-only browser for your configured hooks. The menu shows every hook event with a count of configured hooks, lets you drill into matchers, and shows the full details of each hook handler. Use it to verify configuration, check which settings file a hook came from, or inspect a hook's command, prompt, or URL.

The menu displays all five hook types: `command`, `prompt`, `agent`, `http`, and `mcp_tool`. Each hook is labeled with a `[type]` prefix and a source indicating where it was defined:

* `User`: from `~/.claude/settings.json`
* `Project`: from `.claude/settings.json`
* `Local`: from `.claude/settings.local.json`
* `Plugin`: from a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`
* `Session`: registered in memory for the current session
* `Built-in`: registered internally by Claude Code

Selecting a hook opens a detail view showing its event, matcher, type, source file, and the full command, prompt, or URL. The menu is read-only: to add, modify, or remove hooks, edit the settings JSON directly or ask Claude to make the change.

### Disable or remove hooks

To remove a hook, delete its entry from the settings JSON file.

To temporarily disable all hooks without removing them, set `"disableAllHooks": true` in your settings file. There is no way to disable an individual hook while keeping it in the configuration.

The `disableAllHooks` setting respects the managed settings hierarchy. If an administrator has configured hooks through managed policy settings, `disableAllHooks` set in user, project, or local settings cannot disable those managed hooks. Only `disableAllHooks` set at the managed settings level can disable managed hooks.

Direct edits to hooks in settings files are normally picked up automatically by the file watcher.

## Hook input and output

Command hooks receive JSON data via stdin and communicate results through exit codes, stdout, and stderr. HTTP hooks receive the same JSON as the POST request body and communicate results through the HTTP response body. This section covers fields and behavior common to all events. Each event's section under [Hook events](#hook-events) includes its specific input schema and decision control options.

### Common input fields

Hook events receive these fields as JSON, in addition to event-specific fields documented in each [hook event](#hook-events) section. For command hooks, this JSON arrives via stdin. For HTTP hooks, it arrives as the POST request body.

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `session_id`      | Current session identifier                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `transcript_path` | Path to conversation JSON                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `cwd`             | Current working directory when the hook is invoked                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `permission_mode` | Current [permission mode](/en/permissions#permission-modes): `"default"`, `"plan"`, `"acceptEdits"`, `"auto"`, `"dontAsk"`, or `"bypassPermissions"`. Not all events receive this field: see each event's JSON example below to check |
| `hook_event_name` | Name of the event that fired                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

When running with `--agent` or inside a subagent, two additional fields are included:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_id`   | Unique identifier for the subagent. Present only when the hook fires inside a subagent call. Use this to distinguish subagent hook calls from main-thread calls.                                                                     |
| `agent_type` | Agent name (for example, `"Explore"` or `"security-reviewer"`). Present when the session uses `--agent` or the hook fires inside a subagent. For subagents, the subagent's type takes precedence over the session's `--agent` value. |

For example, a `PreToolUse` hook for a Bash command receives this on stdin:

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/home/user/.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/home/user/my-project",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "npm test"
  }
}
```

The `tool_name` and `tool_input` fields are event-specific. Each [hook event](#hook-events) section documents the additional fields for that event.

### Exit code output

The exit code from your hook command tells Claude Code whether the action should proceed, be blocked, or be ignored.

**Exit 0** means success. Claude Code parses stdout for [JSON output fields](#json-output). JSON output is only processed on exit 0. For most events, stdout is written to the debug log but not shown in the transcript. The exceptions are `UserPromptSubmit`, `UserPromptExpansion`, and `SessionStart`, where stdout is added as context that Claude can see and act on.

**Exit 2** means a blocking error. Claude Code ignores stdout and any JSON in it. Instead, stderr text is fed back to Claude as an error message. The effect depends on the event: `PreToolUse` blocks the tool call, `UserPromptSubmit` rejects the prompt, and so on. See [exit code 2 behavior](#exit-code-2-behavior-per-event) for the full list.

**Any other exit code** is a non-blocking error for most hook events. The transcript shows a `<hook name> hook error` notice followed by the first line of stderr, so you can identify the cause without `--debug`. Execution continues and the full stderr is written to the debug log.

For example, a hook command script that blocks dangerous Bash commands:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# Reads JSON input from stdin, checks the command
command=$(jq -r '.tool_input.command' < /dev/stdin)

if [[ "$command" == rm* ]]; then
  echo "Blocked: rm commands are not allowed" >&2
  exit 2  # Blocking error: tool call is prevented
fi

exit 0  # Success: tool call proceeds
```

<Warning>
  For most hook events, only exit code 2 blocks the action. Claude Code treats exit code 1 as a non-blocking error and proceeds with the action, even though 1 is the conventional Unix failure code. If your hook is meant to enforce a policy, use `exit 2`. The exception is `WorktreeCreate`, where any non-zero exit code aborts worktree creation.
</Warning>

#### Exit code 2 behavior per event

Exit code 2 is the way a hook signals "stop, don't do this." The effect depends on the event, because some events represent actions that can be blocked (like a tool call that hasn't happened yet) and others represent things that already happened or can't be prevented.

| Hook event            | Can block? | What happens on exit 2                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PreToolUse`          | Yes        | Blocks the tool call                                                                                                                 |
| `PermissionRequest`   | Yes        | Denies the permission                                                                                                                |
| `UserPromptSubmit`    | Yes        | Blocks prompt processing and erases the prompt                                                                                       |
| `UserPromptExpansion` | Yes        | Blocks the expansion                                                                                                                 |
| `Stop`                | Yes        | Prevents Claude from stopping, continues the conversation                                                                            |
| `SubagentStop`        | Yes        | Prevents the subagent from stopping                                                                                                  |
| `TeammateIdle`        | Yes        | Prevents the teammate from going idle (teammate continues working)                                                                   |
| `TaskCreated`         | Yes        | Rolls back the task creation                                                                                                         |
| `TaskCompleted`       | Yes        | Prevents the task from being marked as completed                                                                                     |
| `ConfigChange`        | Yes        | Blocks the configuration change from taking effect (except `policy_settings`)                                                        |
| `StopFailure`         | No         | Output and exit code are ignored                                                                                                     |

### HTTP response handling

HTTP hooks use HTTP status codes and response bodies instead of exit codes and stdout:

* **2xx with an empty body**: success, equivalent to exit code 0 with no output
* **2xx with a plain text body**: success, the text is added as context
* **2xx with a JSON body**: success, parsed using the same [JSON output](#json-output) schema as command hooks
* **Non-2xx status**: non-blocking error, execution continues
* **Connection failure or timeout**: non-blocking error, execution continues

Unlike command hooks, HTTP hooks cannot signal a blocking error through status codes alone. To block a tool call or deny a permission, return a 2xx response with a JSON body containing the appropriate decision fields.

### JSON output

Exit codes let you allow or block, but JSON output gives you finer-grained control. Instead of exiting with code 2 to block, exit 0 and print a JSON object to stdout. Claude Code reads specific fields from that JSON to control behavior, including [decision control](#decision-control) for blocking, allowing, or escalating to the user.

<Note>
  You must choose one approach per hook, not both: either use exit codes alone for signaling, or exit 0 and print JSON for structured control. Claude Code only processes JSON on exit 0. If you exit 2, any JSON is ignored.
</Note>

Your hook's stdout must contain only the JSON object. If your shell profile prints text on startup, it can interfere with JSON parsing. See [JSON validation failed](/en/hooks-guide#json-validation-failed) in the troubleshooting guide.

Hook output injected into context (`additionalContext`, `systemMessage`, or plain stdout) is capped at 10,000 characters. Output that exceeds this limit is saved to a file and replaced with a preview and file path, the same way large tool results are handled.

The JSON object supports three kinds of fields:

* **Universal fields** like `continue` work across all events. These are listed in the table below.
* **Top-level `decision` and `reason`** are used by some events to block or provide feedback.
* **`hookSpecificOutput`** is a nested object for events that need richer control. It requires a `hookEventName` field set to the event name.

| Field            | Default | Description                                                                                                                |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `continue`       | `true`  | If `false`, Claude stops processing entirely after the hook runs. Takes precedence over any event-specific decision fields |
| `stopReason`     | none    | Message shown to the user when `continue` is `false`. Not shown to Claude                                                  |
| `suppressOutput` | `false` | If `true`, omits stdout from the debug log                                                                                 |
| `systemMessage`  | none    | Warning message shown to the user                                                                                          |

To stop Claude entirely regardless of event type:

```json theme={null}
{ "continue": false, "stopReason": "Build failed, fix errors before continuing" }
```

#### Add context for Claude

The `additionalContext` field passes a string from your hook into Claude's context window. Claude Code wraps the string in a system reminder and inserts it into the conversation at the point where the hook fired. Claude reads the reminder on the next model request, but it does not appear as a chat message in the interface.

Return `additionalContext` inside `hookSpecificOutput` alongside the event name:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "This file is generated. Edit src/schema.ts and run `bun generate` instead."
  }
}
```

Where the reminder appears depends on the event:

* [SessionStart](#sessionstart), [Setup](#setup), and [SubagentStart](#subagentstart): at the start of the conversation, before the first prompt
* [UserPromptSubmit](#userpromptsubmit) and [UserPromptExpansion](#userpromptexpansion): alongside the submitted prompt
* [PreToolUse](#pretooluse), [PostToolUse](#posttooluse), [PostToolUseFailure](#posttoolusefailure), and [PostToolBatch](#posttoolbatch): next to the tool result

When several hooks return `additionalContext` for the same event, Claude receives all of the values. If a value exceeds 10,000 characters, Claude Code writes the full text to a file in the session directory and passes Claude the file path with a short preview instead.

Use `additionalContext` for information Claude should know about the current state of your environment or the operation that just ran:

* **Environment state**: the current branch, deployment target, or active feature flags
* **Conditional project rules**: which test command applies to the file just edited, which directories are read-only in this worktree
* **External data**: open issues assigned to you, recent CI results, content fetched from an internal service

For instructions that never change, prefer [CLAUDE.md](/en/memory). It loads without running a script and is the standard place for static project conventions.

Write the text as factual statements rather than imperative system instructions. Phrasing such as "The deployment target is production" or "This repo uses `bun test`" reads as project information. Text framed as out-of-band system commands can trigger Claude's prompt-injection defenses, which causes Claude to surface the text to you instead of treating it as context.

Once injected, the text is saved in the session transcript. For mid-session events like `PostToolUse` or `UserPromptSubmit`, resuming with `--continue` or `--resume` replays the saved text rather than re-running the hook for past turns, so values like timestamps or commit SHAs become stale on resume. `SessionStart` hooks run again on resume with `source` set to `"resume"`, so they can refresh their context.

#### Decision control

Not every event supports blocking or controlling behavior through JSON. The events that do each use a different set of fields to express that decision. Use this table as a quick reference before writing a hook:

| Events                                                                                                                              | Decision pattern               | Key fields                                                                                                                                                          |

JSON `{"continue": false, "stopReason": "..."}` also stops the teammate entirely, matching `Stop` hook behavior |

## Hook events

Each event corresponds to a point in Claude Code's lifecycle where hooks can run. Per-event details — including JSON input schema, decision control options, matchers, and worked examples — are documented at: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#hook-events

The events covered by the upstream reference are:

- SessionStart
- Setup
- InstructionsLoaded
- UserPromptSubmit
- UserPromptExpansion
- PreToolUse (with full per-tool input schemas: Bash, Write, Edit, Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch, Agent, AskUserQuestion)
- PermissionRequest (with permission update entries for `addRules`, `replaceRules`, `removeRules`, `setMode`, `addDirectories`, `removeDirectories`)
- PostToolUse
- PostToolUseFailure
- PostToolBatch
- PermissionDenied
- Notification
- SubagentStart
- SubagentStop
- TaskCreated
- TaskCompleted
- Stop

- CwdChanged
- FileChanged
- WorktreeCreate
- WorktreeRemove
- PreCompact
- PostCompact
- SessionEnd
- Elicitation
- ElicitationResult

(Per-event JSON schemas, decision-control field tables, and full code examples preserved at the source URL above.)

## Prompt-based hooks

In addition to command, HTTP, and MCP tool hooks, Claude Code supports prompt-based hooks (`type: "prompt"`) that use an LLM to evaluate whether to allow or block an action, and agent hooks (`type: "agent"`) that spawn an agentic verifier with tool access. Not all events support every hook type.

Events that support all five hook types (`command`, `http`, `mcp_tool`, `prompt`, and `agent`):

* `PermissionRequest`
* `PostToolBatch`
* `PostToolUse`
* `PostToolUseFailure`
* `PreToolUse`
* `Stop`
* `SubagentStop`
* `TaskCompleted`
* `TaskCreated`
* `UserPromptExpansion`
* `UserPromptSubmit`

Events that support `command`, `http`, and `mcp_tool` hooks but not `prompt` or `agent`:

* `ConfigChange`
* `CwdChanged`
* `Elicitation`
* `ElicitationResult`
* `FileChanged`
* `InstructionsLoaded`
* `Notification`
* `PermissionDenied`
* `PostCompact`
* `PreCompact`
* `SessionEnd`
* `StopFailure`
* `SubagentStart`
* `TeammateIdle`
* `WorktreeCreate`
* `WorktreeRemove`

`SessionStart` and `Setup` support `command` and `mcp_tool` hooks. They do not support `http`, `prompt`, or `agent` hooks.

### How prompt-based hooks work

Instead of executing a Bash command, prompt-based hooks:

1. Send the hook input and your prompt to a Claude model, Haiku by default
2. The LLM responds with structured JSON containing a decision
3. Claude Code processes the decision automatically

### Prompt hook configuration

Set `type` to `"prompt"` and provide a `prompt` string instead of a `command`. Use the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder to inject the hook's JSON input data into your prompt text. Claude Code sends the combined prompt and input to a fast Claude model, which returns a JSON decision.

This `Stop` hook asks the LLM to evaluate whether all tasks are complete before allowing Claude to finish:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "Evaluate if Claude should stop: $ARGUMENTS. Check if all tasks are complete."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| `timeout` | no       | Timeout in seconds. Default: 30                                                                                                                                     |

### Response schema

The LLM must respond with JSON containing:

```json theme={null}
{
  "ok": true | false,
  "reason": "Explanation for the decision"
}
```

| Field    | Description                                                |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ok`     | `true` allows the action, `false` prevents it              |
| `reason` | Required when `ok` is `false`. Explanation shown to Claude |

### Example: Multi-criteria Stop hook

This `Stop` hook uses a detailed prompt to check three conditions before allowing Claude to stop. If `"ok"` is `false`, Claude continues working with the provided reason as its next instruction. `SubagentStop` hooks use the same format to evaluate whether a [subagent](/en/sub-agents) should stop:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "You are evaluating whether Claude should stop working. Context: $ARGUMENTS\n\nAnalyze the conversation and determine if:\n1. All user-requested tasks are complete\n2. Any errors need to be addressed\n3. Follow-up work is needed\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"ok\": true} to allow stopping, or {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"your explanation\"} to continue working.",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Agent-based hooks

<Warning>
  Agent hooks are experimental. Behavior and configuration may change in future releases. For production workflows, prefer [command hooks](#command-hook-fields).
</Warning>

Agent-based hooks (`type: "agent"`) are like prompt-based hooks but with multi-turn tool access. Instead of a single LLM call, an agent hook spawns a subagent that can read files, search code, and inspect the codebase to verify conditions. Agent hooks support the same events as prompt-based hooks.

### How agent hooks work

When an agent hook fires:

1. Claude Code spawns a subagent with your prompt and the hook's JSON input
2. The subagent can use tools like Read, Grep, and Glob to investigate
3. After up to 50 turns, the subagent returns a structured `{ "ok": true/false }` decision
4. Claude Code processes the decision the same way as a prompt hook

Agent hooks are useful when verification requires inspecting actual files or test output, not just evaluating the hook input data alone.

### Agent hook configuration

Set `type` to `"agent"` and provide a `prompt` string. The configuration fields are the same as [prompt hooks](#prompt-hook-configuration), with a longer default timeout:

| Field     | Required | Description                                                                                 |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`    | yes      | Must be `"agent"`                                                                           |
| `prompt`  | yes      | Prompt describing what to verify. Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a placeholder for the hook input JSON |
| `model`   | no       | Model to use. Defaults to a fast model                                                      |
| `timeout` | no       | Timeout in seconds. Default: 60                                                             |

The response schema is the same as prompt hooks: `{ "ok": true }` to allow or `{ "ok": false, "reason": "..." }` to block.

This `Stop` hook verifies that all unit tests pass before allowing Claude to finish:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "agent",
            "prompt": "Verify that all unit tests pass. Run the test suite and check the results. $ARGUMENTS",
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Run hooks in the background

By default, hooks block Claude's execution until they complete. For long-running tasks like deployments, test suites, or external API calls, set `"async": true` to run the hook in the background while Claude continues working. Async hooks cannot block or control Claude's behavior: response fields like `decision`, `permissionDecision`, and `continue` have no effect, because the action they would have controlled has already completed.

### Configure an async hook

Add `"async": true` to a command hook's configuration to run it in the background without blocking Claude. This field is only available on `type: "command"` hooks.

This hook runs a test script after every `Write` tool call. Claude continues working immediately while `run-tests.sh` executes for up to 120 seconds. When the script finishes, its output is delivered on the next conversation turn:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/run-tests.sh",
            "async": true,
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `timeout` field sets the maximum time in seconds for the background process. If not specified, async hooks use the same 10-minute default as sync hooks.

### How async hooks execute

When an async hook fires, Claude Code starts the hook process and immediately continues without waiting for it to finish. The hook receives the same JSON input via stdin as a synchronous hook.

After the background process exits, if the hook produced a JSON response with a `systemMessage` or `additionalContext` field, that content is delivered to Claude as context on the next conversation turn.

Async hook completion notifications are suppressed by default. To see them, enable verbose mode with `Ctrl+O` or start Claude Code with `--verbose`.

### Limitations

Async hooks have several constraints compared to synchronous hooks:

* Only `type: "command"` hooks support `async`. Prompt-based hooks cannot run asynchronously.
* Async hooks cannot block tool calls or return decisions. By the time the hook completes, the triggering action has already proceeded.
* Hook output is delivered on the next conversation turn. If the session is idle, the response waits until the next user interaction. Exception: an `asyncRewake` hook that exits with code 2 wakes Claude immediately even when the session is idle.
* Each execution creates a separate background process. There is no deduplication across multiple firings of the same async hook.

## Security considerations

### Disclaimer

Command hooks run with your system user's full permissions.

<Warning>
  Command hooks execute shell commands with your full user permissions. They can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access. Review and test all hook commands before adding them to your configuration.
</Warning>

### Security best practices

Keep these practices in mind when writing hooks:

* **Validate and sanitize inputs**: never trust input data blindly
* **Always quote shell variables**: use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
* **Block path traversal**: check for `..` in file paths
* **Use absolute paths**: specify full paths for scripts, using `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"` for the project root
* **Skip sensitive files**: avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

## Windows PowerShell tool

On Windows, you can run individual hooks in PowerShell by setting `"shell": "powershell"` on a command hook. Hooks spawn PowerShell directly, so this works regardless of whether `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL` is set. Claude Code auto-detects `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) with a fallback to `powershell.exe` (5.1).

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "shell": "powershell",
            "command": "Write-Host 'File written'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Debug hooks

Hook execution details, including which hooks matched, their exit codes, and full stdout and stderr, are written to the debug log file. Start Claude Code with `claude --debug-file <path>` to write the log to a known location, or run `claude --debug` and read the log at `~/.claude/debug/<session-id>.txt`. The `--debug` flag does not print to the terminal.

```text theme={null}
[DEBUG] Executing hooks for PostToolUse:Write
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook commands to execute
[DEBUG] Executing hook command: <Your command> with timeout 600000ms
[DEBUG] Hook command completed with status 0: <Your stdout>
```

For more granular hook matching details, set `CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL=verbose` to see additional log lines such as hook matcher counts and query matching.
