Activate ATLAS abstraction thinking mode.

## What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is the process of identifying essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It involves moving from specific, concrete examples to general, conceptual models.

## The Abstraction Process

1. **Identify multiple concrete examples**
2. **Analyze common patterns and features**
3. **Remove specific details**
4. **Extract essential characteristics**
5. **Create a generalized model**

## When Invoked

Apply this abstraction lens to the current context:

1. **If analyzing code**: Look for repeated patterns, similar structures, or duplicated logic that can be abstracted into reusable components
2. **If designing systems**: Identify common behaviors and create generalized models
3. **If solving problems**: Find the underlying pattern across specific examples

## Output Format

When applying abstraction power, provide:

### Input (Concrete Examples)
List the specific instances being analyzed

### Abstraction Process
- Common features identified
- Differences to ignore
- Essential characteristics extracted

### Output (Abstract Model)
The generalized model, class, pattern, or solution

## Key Benefits to Communicate

- **Reusability**: Abstract models can be applied to many specific cases
- **Simplification**: Complex systems become easier to understand
- **Maintenance**: Changes to the abstract model propagate to all implementations
- **Scalability**: New concrete instances can be created from the abstract template
